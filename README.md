# ExternallyGuidedMotion
This solution can be used to pick up a disc sliding down a ramp using an industrial ABB robotic arm with EGM implemented.
As a sensor a Cognex In-Sight 5400 smart camera was used. This camera sent the discs position over to the program written in C#. 
All tests were run on an IRB140 industrial robotic arm.
