# ExternalGuidedMotion

This program combined with a program written i RAPID will be used to pick up a ball rolling down a ramp using a ABB robotic arm. 
To detect the ball a camera is used, so this program detect and predict the trajectory of the ball. 
The position data of the ball is sent over to the RAPID program using UDPuc packets.
